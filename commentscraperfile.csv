"Not much of an actual explanation of binary search; a great explanation of indexes.  IF you have up to 256 items, you can find any item in not more than 8 fetches (2 to the 8th power is 256).  65536 items may require up to 16 fetches.  4 billion items may require up to 32 fetches; provided the data (or index) is ordered.  The scaling notation is ""Log N"" as the dataset grows, the number of fetches grows as the base 2 logarithm, which is to say, a whole lot slower; it scales up wonderfully well. 
Closely related is inserting a new item; do a binary search to decide where to put it.  Works great in memory but not on disk; on disk you will almost always append the new item and update your indexes.  If you have not indexed anything then your data is ""unordered""."

"One small complication is the fact that all modern computers are _really_ bad at random access, at all levels: 
In reality, RAM can (and should) only be read or written sequentially, in fairly large blocks: CPUs used cache lines of 64 or 128 bytes as the minimum size.
For anything on disk you want each access to grab a bunch of blocks, typically somewhere in the MB range.

At the same time, all the branching done in each iteration of binary search also hurts, so in reality as soon as you get down to a ""small enough"" remaining partition, it is faster to do a linear search  than to keep splitting in halves."

"2:09 there's also exponential search (start at the lowest index, double it until you've passed the thing you're looking for, then perform a search (usually binary search) between where you ended and the index you looked at right before). It's used when you don't know how many items there are."

"Not only is Dewey decimal an example of an index, it's an example of binary search, and also binary insertion. When books are added, they get a number in between two existing numbers according to some rule. If the new book can't be inserted because the two existing numbers are adjacent, an additional digit is tacked on instead. In this way an infinite number of books can be added without reindexing the existing collection."

"I javascript letters have numerical weight for them, ""a"" > ""b"" is true. I was completely confused when I learned about the ""sort"" method for arrays that operated exclusively on whether it received 1, 0, or -1 I had no idea that here you can do math with letters as if they were numbers."
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
"There are other ways of creating indexes or organising records. It is possible to use hashed random, which can be very good where you are looking for an exact value. You still have to search a short linear list, but it doesn't suffer from some of the insertion problems you can get with ordered data.  

On the subject of what to index on, one very important point is you do not index fields which only have a very few different values. The index can get very unwieldy and you can easily get into the situation whereby finding, say, all the grey cars by index takes a lot longer than just doing a linear search."

"I have worked for a few libraries in my time, and I've come to the opinion that even the modern version of the Dewey system needs a serious update. Not just what the Melvil Decimal System is proposing, but a heavy reordering of several sections to make them more capable of indexing modern library collections. Three examples: 

1.) There is no section for travel guides--they barely existed in Dewey's time, and so they share space with those travel memoirs that haven't been redefined as biographies. 

2.) Most religion categories are occupied by specific topics relating to Christianity and its various denominations. All the other world religions have to share 290-299. This worked great in the USA in 1905...

3.) If something can possibly be indexed by country, it will be. It's no longer strictly European countries that existed in 1905, that's been updated (sort of), but the structure is still there, furthermore, not everything is best indexed by country of origin, and as anyone who's tried to classify World Music will tell you, ""country of origin"" doesn't always tell you what you need to know, in the modern world.

Finally, I'm grateful to Tom for acknowledging Dewey's disturbing and inappropriate behavior. Many librarians are ignorant of this, although that's likely because the story of Dewey's life is essentially irrelevant to a modern librarian."

"Have to disagree. Dewey is about categorising or classifying the books, not sorting them. The sorting is a trivial consequence, as trivial as knowing that the shelf of books published for Feb 1902 will be next to the Mar 1902 books (under an alternative system described). Dewey’s work was to create the a standard set of subject headers under which books could be categorised. Once the categories are established it doesn’t really matter if the 100s are next to the 600s, and you’ll probably find the fiction section (800s) is lighter, warmer and airier than anywhere else.
Anyway, binary searching is just not relevant to Dewey. Binary searching works just as well if every book was organised by author, title, or weight."

"I ran into a problem on a project I developed for Windows 3.1. That seems like a lifetime ago. At the time, there were no decent databases for me to use (or, at least, none that I liked). I figured it was simple enough to keep the data I had sorted and do binary searches. These were non memory searches, but disk. When I went over about 500 entries, I got tragic slowdowns in the search. In retrospect, it was probably a physical issues with record lookups on the hard drive, but whatever the reason, it wasn't working. That's when I decided to go with a hash as the primary lookup. Then binary within the hash group. Searches that once took a minute on only hundreds of records were taking milliseconds on 10s of thousands. Since that time, I haven't had to roll my own, but I'd bet that Google probably isn't managing things with simple binary lookups, however efficient they seem to be."

"Not sure how this came up in my youtube queue. I subscribe 100% to binary search, been using it for years. Take your 1,000,000 approach, is aprox 20 comparisons at worst case to find the result. Add another million, and it's just 1 more comparison. Increase by another factor (total 4 million), and it's just one more comparison, etc. Insertion into the index, is the same - fast. Btw, nice presentation. Though you sitting in front of a museum of old computers was a nice touch, but did confuse me to when this might have been recorded."

"I used to work at a place that had the same or similar model of disk drives that are behind Tom in this video.  When a record had to be read from disk for each test in a search, if a file had  millions of records, because of the time needed for disk I/O, even a binary search would be too slow. We had an indexing system where one read of the index file would bring in dozens to a couple of thousand indices. A search of the indices read would take place in memory, and result in either the location of the record, the discovery the target record didn't exist, or a location where another set of indices were to be read.  The number of disk reads needed was reduced from  (log base 2 N) for a binary search to (log base i N), where i is the number of indices read with one I/O, and N the number of records in the file."
